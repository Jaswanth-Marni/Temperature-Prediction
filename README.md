# Temperature-Prediction

Implemented a temperature prediction model using a pre-integrated dataset, leveraging Python for data processing and Streamlit for visualization.
Utilized Ngrok to create a secure tunnel, enabling remote access to the application.
Designed the interface to accept user inputs for temperature data by year, facilitating easy interaction.
Employed a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to accurately predict temperature trends for future years, providing actionable insights.
